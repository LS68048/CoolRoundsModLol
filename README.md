Cool ROUNDS mod lol

This is a mod I made to mess around with my friends, and I thought I would publish it for other people to have fun too.
Not professional at all.

### Cards
Bundling - Bundle all your bullets together for a super bullet!<br />
Absorption - Steal the bullets that hit you!<br />
Rubber Banding - Go back to wherre you blocked five seconds later!<br />
Fard - this is why I said it's not professional.<br />
Ghost Bullets - Your bullets are ghosts!<br />
Knockback Stick - get a big amount of knockback on your bullets!<br />
Piercing - Your bullets are unblockable!<br />
Teleporting Bullets - You teleport to where your bullet hits!<br />
Uno Reverse - Swap positions with your opponents!<br />

## Mod Status
Due to school, this project is not being actively worked on. Please still report bugs when found, as I will occasionally work on the mod to fix them. You can do this in [the github repo issues tab,](https://github.com/Orangenal-name/CoolRoundsModLol/issues) or in [The Rounds Modding Community Discord Server](https://discord.gg/edegxT9CJH) in the #bug-reports channel (make sure to ping me @Orangenal name#9280)
##### Will there be new cards?
Yes, although I may not be able to work on this mod very often, I will still add cards when me or my friends get the ideas.
