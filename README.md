Cool ROUNDS mod lol

This is a mod I made to mess around with my friends, and I thought I would publish it for other people to have fun too.
Not professional at all.

### Cards
Bundling - Bundle all your bullets together for a super bullet!<br />
Absorption - Steal the bullets that hit you!<br />
Rubber Banding - Go back to where you blocked five seconds later!<br />
Fard - this is why I said it's not professional.<br />
Ghost Bullets - Your bullets are ghosts!<br />
Knockback Stick - get a big amount of knockback on your bullets!<br />
Piercing - Your bullets are unblockable!<br />
Teleporting Bullets - You teleport to where your bullet hits!<br />
Uno Reverse - Swap positions with your opponents!<br />
Pew pew - Pew pew!<br />
Banana Peels - Slip around!<br />

#### Will there be new cards?
Yes, although I may not be able to work on this mod very often, I will still add cards when me or my friends get the ideas.
